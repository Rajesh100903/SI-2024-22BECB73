Cubesats are small and standardized spacecraft used primarily for research purposes, typically launched into space as secondary payloads on larger missions or as part of dedicated small satellite launch programs. Here's a comprehensive overview of cubesats:
### Characteristics of Cubesats:
#### Size:
Cubesats are small satellites with a standardized form factor based on cubic units called "units" or "U".
The most common size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm (1U), but larger configurations such as 2U (10 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm) and 3U (10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm) are also prevalent.
They typically weigh between 1 to 10 kilograms, though larger variants exist.
#### Standardization:
Cubesats adhere to standards established by the CubeSat Program started by Cal Poly (California Polytechnic State University) and Stanford University.
These standards ensure interoperability, ease of integration, and reduced costs for development and launch.
#### Purpose and Applications:
Cubesats serve a variety of purposes, including scientific research, technology demonstration, Earth observation, telecommunications, and educational outreach.
They are often used by universities, research institutions, and commercial entities to conduct experiments and validate new technologies in space.
#### Launch Opportunities:
Cubesats are typically launched as secondary payloads on rockets carrying larger primary payloads.
They may also be launched through dedicated small satellite launch services or deployed from the International Space Station (ISS).
#### Components and Systems:
Cubesats are equipped with standard subsystems including power systems (solar panels and batteries), communication systems, on-board computers, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and payload instruments.
They may feature deployable antennas, solar arrays, and propulsion systems depending on mission requirements.
#### Mission Durations:
Cubesats have varying mission durations depending on their orbit and objectives.
Some cubesats operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and have shorter lifespans (months to a few years), while others may be placed in higher orbits for longer-duration missions.
Advantages:
##### Lower cost compared to traditional larger satellites, making them accessible for educational and research purposes.
##### Rapid development and deployment timelines compared to larger satellites.
#### Challenges:
###### Limited payload capacity and volume for scientific instruments and subsystems.
###### Dependence on primary mission schedules for launch opportunities.
###### Limited communication and power capabilities compared to larger satellites.
### Examples of Cubesat Missions:
###### Educational: Universities use cubesats for hands-on training in space technology and engineering.
###### Scientific Research: Conducting experiments in microgravity, studying Earth's atmosphere, monitoring climate change, etc.
###### Technology Demonstration: Testing new sensors, communication systems, propulsion methods, etc.
###### Commercial Applications: Providing Earth observation services, satellite communications, and internet-of-things (IoT) connectivity.

## Lab-2 Intro to GPIO Programming
-Blinking LED lights are some of the most popular bulbs used today. The blinking light is simply a light that goes on and off in a specific pattern. The pattern can be fast or slow and the lights can be a solid color or a variety of different colors.
-Here we go to the code we can refer to for LED blinking.
##### code for led dimming ðŸ’¡
```C
int LEDpin = 13;
int delayT = 1000;

An organic light-emitting diode (OLED), also known as organic electroluminescent (organic EL) diode,[1][2] is a type of light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is an organic compound film that emits light in response to an electric current. This organic layer is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, and portable systems such as smartphones and handheld game consoles. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.

## Lab-5 Computing Signal Processing using Python through WSL and TLE ðŸ“¶ðŸ“¡
In signal processing, FFT forms the basis of frequency domain analysis (spectral analysis) and is used for signal filtering, spectral estimation, data compression, and other applications. Variations of the FFT such as the short-time Fourier transform also allow for simultaneous analysis in time and frequency domains. 
-In this module we would be using python to simulate signal processing.Python is a widely used interpreted language used in industries for data management, signal processing, application devolopment.

A two-line element set (TLE, or more rarely 2LE) or three-line element set (3LE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the epoch. Using a suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. The TLE data representation is specific to the simplified perturbations models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest. TLEs can describe the trajectories only of Earth-orbiting objects. TLEs are widely used as input for projecting the future orbital tracks of space debris for purposes of characterizing "future debris events to support risk analysis, close approach analysis, collision avoidance maneuvering" and forensic analysis

code for latitude and longitude generation using TLE is as follows->[TLE](https://github.com/Rajesh100903/SI-2024-22BECB73/blob/main/Lab/TLE)

###### Latitude was generated to be as 33.07590399036185 longitude was -39.341103283558745 and altitude was 830.8149737295089 kms
